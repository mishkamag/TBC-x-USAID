# The Structure of Project

I have divided the project into 3 main parts, Header, Main and Footer.
All sections have the same container that adjusts to be centered and sized accordingly.

### Header

Inside Header, I have only navigation that changes according to responsiveness.

### Main

Inside main, I have several sections and I will tell you what technologies I used to create each one:

#### Hero and Hero's title

This is the section where the image in the middle has text , for this I used "background image" property and parsed the text without any "position absolute".

#### All courses section

For all courses section, I have created a separate javascript file where I have data for each of them and render each of them also via javascript. Also used "grid", which has "repeat(auto-fit, minmax)" property and this takes the appropriate size for each course's card according to the size of the tablet.

#### Partniors carusel section

I have divided the partners section into 3 blocks, I have made a "carousel" and these blocks change each other both manually on "click" and automatically every 4 seconds

### Footer

In the footer section, I have placed additional icons and information about the site
